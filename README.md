# libovc

libovc is a (cross-platform) library to extract all the known information from
an OV-chipkaart dump. This started out as a 'proof of concept' and should be
considered as alpha quality. Also note that some information could be wrong as
it has not been checked by the community (ie. the class type, extra transaction
data, etc.).

Seeing as the research has stalled since the introduction of the new chip, the
further development of this library seems useless at this time. At least until
there is another hack or if the encryption is dropped (which is never going to
happen though).

## Acquiring dumps

 * [Linux](http://www.ov-chipkaart.de/blog/?page_id=126)
 * [Windows](http://www.ov-chipkaart.de/blog/?page_id=132)

 * [mfocGUI](http://www.huuf.info/OV/)


## Build Instructions

libovc is developed and tested on Linux. Building it on other platforms should
be possible though.

### Linux

    $ make

### Windows

To be done? Should be possible but it has not been tested.
